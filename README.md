This is an implementation of a minimal language called 'weed'.

In the first pass '*.weed' is converted to '*.asm'

In the second pass the '*.asm' file is executed by the weed_vm

To run a program written in this language:

ruby get_high.rb <your_weed_program_here>

Eg. ruby get_high.rb weed_samples/hello_world.weed
